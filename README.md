# Automated Mortgage Payments

## 🏡 Project Description
The Automated Mortgage Payments project is a blockchain-based smart contract system built on Ethereum. It allows borrowers to make secure, transparent, and automated mortgage payments to a lender over a defined period. The contract enforces payment timelines, tracks remaining balances, and automates fund transfers, reducing reliance on intermediaries.

## 🎯 Project Vision
To simplify and automate the mortgage payment process using decentralized smart contracts, ensuring financial transparency, punctuality, and trust between lenders and borrowers without the need for a central authority.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Smart Contract Enforcement**: Payments are locked and sent automatically to the lender once conditions are met.
- **Time-Based Payments**: Borrowers must pay monthly on schedule (every 30 days).
- **Transparency**: All transactions are recorded on the blockchain, accessible by both lender and borrower.
- **Mortgage Status Tracking**: Tracks remaining balance, due dates, and status (active/completed).
- **Termination Option**: Lender can terminate the mortgage manually in case of unforeseen issues.

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Integration with real-world payment gateways (via Chainlink oracles).
- Late payment penalties or grace period features.
- Frontend DApp for borrowers and lenders to interact with the contract visually.
- Multi-borrower and multi-lender support.
- Credit scoring based on on-chain behavior.
